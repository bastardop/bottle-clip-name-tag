Bottle clip with name and logo
==============================

This thing is a simple clip with your name on it which can be used to mark your
bottles.

The clip is customizable and you can tweak the following parameters:

 * radius on the upper and lower side, for easy adaptation to other bottle
	 types. The script includes examples for standard 0.5l Club Mate bottles as
	 well as german 0.33l bottles.
 * wall thickness (though the default should be okay for easy clipping)
 

Instructions
------------

First, get all prerequisites. If you cloned this repository with Git, all you
have to do is change into the repository and do a `git submodule init && git
submodule update`.

Open `bottle-clip.scad` in OpenSCAD. At the end of the file, there is a
template for 4 bottle name tags which you can adapt to build your own.
